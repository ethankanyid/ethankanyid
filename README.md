# Hi, I'm Ethan!

## About Me

 I am a senior Computer Science student at Washington State University, graduating in Spring 2026 and specializing in cybersecurity. Currently, I contribute to secure infrastructure at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory by developing data workflows with Python, SQL, and Apache Airflow. I have a strong foundation in low-level computing, including C/C++ and Linux systems, and maintain a 3.95 GPA. Additionally, I actively participate in national cybersecurity competitions to sharpen my skills.

I am self-motivated and value family, teamwork, and meaningful personal connections. I earned my Associateâ€™s degree from Columbia Basin College while still in high school and took a gap year to attend Legacy Bible Institute. This experience led to a life-changing opportunity to work with over 1,400 youth at Life Song for Orphans in Zambia. 

##### **_<u>As of 6-01-2025 I started all my repositories from scratch to ensure I was not compromising confidential information, which means my git history is not as robust as it once was.</u>_**
